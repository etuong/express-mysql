# express-mysql

API using MySQL to give information on classes taught by teachers and taken by students

Generally, Node.js is coupled with MongoDB and other NoSQL databases but can also performs well with relational databases. In this project, we are going to use MySQL, one of the worldâ€™s most popular open source databases, to build a REST API.

## Setting up an instance of MySQL
You may choose to run MySQL locally, or use a free cloud version such as [db4free](https://db4free.net/)
